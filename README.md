# Moonlight PC

[Moonlight PC](http://moonlight-stream.com) is an open source implementation of NVIDIA's GameStream, as used by the NVIDIA Shield, but built to run on Windows, Mac, and Linux.

Moonlight also has mobile versions for [Android](https://github.com/moonlight-stream/moonlight-android) and  [iOS](https://github.com/moonlight-stream/moonlight-ios).

This is a work-in-progress port and is only suitable for development use at this point.

3. Run `git submodule update --init --recursive` from within `moonlight-qt/`
4. Open the project in Qt Creator or build from qmake on the command line
